      <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
      <p>
        Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts,
        as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece. It was also
        described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would
        export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states.
